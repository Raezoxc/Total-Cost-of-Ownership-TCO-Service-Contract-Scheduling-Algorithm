# Total-Cost-of-Ownership-TCO-Service-Contract-Scheduling-Algorithm
This project involved designing a complete analytical framework to calculate the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for equipment over multiple years, while also building an algorithm to automate service contract scheduling based on manufacturing and purchase timelines.

### Power BI • DAX • Data Modelling • SQL

This project calculates the **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** for equipment across multiple years and includes a custom-built **service contract scheduling algorithm** that automatically assigns each product to service year categories (Y1, Y2, Y3…) based on manufacturing and purchase timelines.

## 📌 Project Summary  
I designed a complete analytical framework in **Power BI** to help Finance, Operations, and Service teams understand:

- Multi-year contract profitability  
- True lifecycle cost of products  
- Accurate scheduling of service obligations  
- Contract renewal planning and workload forecasting  

The solution replaces manual spreadsheets with a fully automated, rules-based engine.

## 🧠 Service Contract Scheduling Algorithm  
A DAX-driven logic engine automatically assigns each product into:

| Service Year | Logic |
|--------------|-------|
| **Y1** | Purchase date → end of year 1 |
| **Y2** | Follows Y1 based on contract rules |
| **Y3** | Follows Y2 automatically |

The algorithm dynamically recalculates based on:

- Purchase date  
- Manufacturing date  
- Warranty length  
- Lead time  
- Contract duration  
- Product type  

This eliminated manual categorisation and improved forecasting accuracy.
