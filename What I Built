# 🛠️ Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Service Contract Scheduling Algorithm  
### Power BI • DAX • Data Modelling • SQL

This project calculates the **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** for equipment across multiple years and includes a custom-built **service contract scheduling algorithm** that automatically assigns each product to service year categories (Y1, Y2, Y3…) based on manufacturing and purchase timelines.

---

## 📌 Project Summary  
I designed a complete analytical framework in **Power BI** to help Finance, Operations, and Service teams understand:

- Multi-year contract profitability  
- True lifecycle cost of products  
- Accurate scheduling of service obligations  
- Contract renewal planning and workload forecasting  

The solution replaces manual spreadsheets with a fully automated, rules-based engine.

## 🧠 Service Contract Scheduling Algorithm  
A DAX-driven logic engine automatically assigns each product into:

| Service Year | Logic |
|--------------|-------|
| **Y1** | Purchase date → end of year 1 |
| **Y2** | Follows Y1 based on contract rules |
| **Y3** | Follows Y2 automatically |

The algorithm dynamically recalculates based on:

- Purchase date  
- Manufacturing date  
- Warranty length  
- Lead time  
- Contract duration  
- Product type  

This eliminated manual categorisation and improved forecasting accuracy.
